# Project Status

## Completed Tasks

### Data Ingestion Service

*   **Product Ingestion**: Implemented an endpoint to receive and process product data from Shopify webhooks.
*   **Customer Ingestion**: Implemented an endpoint to receive and process customer data from Shopify webhooks. The service handles customer creation and updates, including address information.
*   **Order Ingestion**: Implemented an endpoint to receive and process order data from Shopify webhooks. The service uses database transactions to ensure data integrity and handles the creation of orders and order items.
*   **Custom Event Ingestion (Bonus)**: Implemented an endpoint to receive and process custom events from Shopify webhooks, including:
    *   `checkouts/create` (checkout started)
    *   `checkouts/update` (checkout updated)
    *   `checkouts/delete` (checkout deleted)

### Backend & API

*   **Multi-Tenancy:** Implemented data isolation for all dashboard endpoints based on the logged-in user's store (tenant).
*   **Webhook Automation:** Implemented automated subscription to essential Shopify webhooks (`orders`, `products`, `customers`, `checkouts`) upon new store registration.
*   **CORS:** Configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to allow the frontend application to communicate with the backend API.
*   **Dashboard APIs**: Developed API endpoints for total customers, orders, revenue, orders by date, and top customers.

### Frontend Application (HTML, CSS, JS)

*   **Authentication:**
    *   Built a complete user authentication system with Login and Signup pages.
    *   Implemented a secure, multi-step Signup process with OTP email verification.
    *   Integrated JWT for session management, including automatic token refresh.
*   **User & Store Management:**
    *   Developed a **Profile Page** allowing users to view and update their personal information.
    *   Implemented a secure flow for updating a user's email address with OTP confirmation.
    *   Created a **Store Registration Page** for users to connect their Shopify store.
*   **Insights Dashboard:**
    *   Built a dynamic dashboard page to display key business metrics.
    *   Visualized "Orders by Date" using the Chart.js library.
    *   Displayed key stats (Total Customers, Orders, Revenue) and a list of Top 5 Customers.
*   **User Experience:**
    *   Designed a single-page application experience with a central navigation bar and a post-login welcome screen.

## Next Steps

*   **Documentation:** Create the final `README.md` including an architecture diagram, setup instructions, and API documentation.
*   **Advanced Features (Optional):**
    *   Add more complex charts and trend analysis to the dashboard.
    *   Refine UI/UX and styling.
